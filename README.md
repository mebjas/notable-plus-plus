## Source

This is based on an older fork of former open source [notable](https://github.com/notable/notable) app. The fork was done on **[v1.3.0](https://github.com/notable/notable/tree/v1.3.0)** which as the author quotes

> v1.0.0..v1.3.0: These initial releases have been published under the permissive MIT license, you can find v1.3.0's source code [here](https://github.com/notable/notable/tree/v1.3.0).

All updates will be made considering [MIT license](https://github.com/notable/notable/tree/v1.3.0) in mind.

## License

Only older versions of the app are open-sourced, read more about this [here](https://github.com/notable/notable/blob/master/SOURCE_CODE.md).
